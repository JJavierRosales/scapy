    "# [Collision Avoidance Challenge](https://kelvins.esa.int/collision-avoidance-challenge/home/)\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Today, active **collision avoidance** among orbiting satellites has become a routine task in space operations, relying on validated, accurate and timely space surveillance data. For a typical satellite in Low Earth Orbit, hundreds of alerts are issued every week corresponding to possible close encounters between a satellite and another space object (in the form of conjunction data messages CDMs). After automatic processing and filtering, there remain about 2 actionable alerts per spacecraft and week, requiring detailed follow-up by an analyst. On average, at the European Space Agency, more than one collision avoidance manoeuvre is performed per satellite and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you are tasked to build a model to predict the final collision risk estimate between a given satellite and a space object (e.g. another satellite, space debris, etc). To do so, you will have access to a database of real-world conjunction data messages (CDMs) carefully prepared at ESA. Learn more about the challenge and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition is organized by ESA's Advanced Concepts Team (ACT) in partnership with ESA's Space Debris Office\n",
    "\n",
    "Experts from both teams are available for interactions during the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "As of estimations done in January 2019, more than 34,000 objects with a size larger than 10cm are orbiting our planet. Of these, 22,300 are tracked by the Space Surveillance Network and their position released in the form of a globally shared catalogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ESA's Space Debris Office supports collision avoidance activities covering the ESA missions Aeolus, Cryosat-2 and the constellation of Swarm-A/B/C in low-Earth orbit and Cluster-II in highly eccentric orbit approaching the Geostationary (GEO) region. On top of these, more than a dozen spacecraft of partner agencies and commercial operators are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://kelvins.esa.int/media/public/ckeditor_uploads/2021/08/05/new_swarm.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this activity, the orbits of these satellites are propagated and when a close approach with any object in the catalogue is detected a **Conjunction Data Message** (CDM) is assembled and released. Each CDM **contains multiple attributes** about the approach, such as the identity of the satellite in question, the object type of the potential collider, the time of closest approach (TCA), the uncertainty (i.e. covariances), etc. It also contains a **self-reported** risk, which is computed using some of the attributes from the CDM. In the days following the first CDM, as the uncertainties of the objects positions become smaller, other CDMs are released refining the knowledge acquired on the close encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a **time series** of CDMs covering one week is released **for each unique close approach**, with about 3 CDMs becoming available per day. For a given close approach the last obtained CDM, including the computed risk, can be assumed to be the **best knowledge** we have about the potential collision and the state of the two objects in question. In most cases, the Space Debris Office will alarm control teams and start thinking about a potential avoidance manoeuvre 2 days prior to the close approach in order to avoid the risk of collision, to then make a final decision 1 day prior. In this challenge, we ask to **build a model** that makes use of the CDMs recorded up to 2 days prior to the closest approach to **predict the final risk** (i.e. the risk predicted in the last available CDM prior to close approach).\n",
    "\n",
    "More about the dataset used in this competition and the attributes contained in the various CDMs can be found in the data section. You can also learn some more about the current way ESA's Space Debris office deals with collision avoidance manoeuvres reading this [paper](https://kelvins.esa.int/media/public/competitions/collision-avoidance-challenge/SDC7-paper1017.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "We thank the US Space Surveillance Network for the provision of surveillance data supporting safe operations of ESAâ€™s spacecraft. Specifically, we are grateful to the agreement which allows to publicly release the dataset for the purpose of this competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between Training and Testing Data\n",
    "Each dataset is made of several unique events (close encounters betwen two objects) which are indexed by a unique number in the `event_i` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `training` set has 162634 rows and **13154 unique events** (giving on average about 12 rows/CDMs per close encounter).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `testing` set has 24484 rows and **2167 unique events** (giving on average about 11 rows/CDMs per close encounter).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: Note that the `testing` set and the `training` set have not been randomly sampled from the database. In other words, while they come from the same database, with the same collection process and the same features, they have been hand picked in order to over-represent high risk events and to create an interesting predictive model. This is a characterstic of this competition where high risk events are scarce, but represent the true final target of a useful predictive model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the `testing` data differs in two major ways compared to the `training` set:\n",
    "\n",
    " * It only contains events for which the latest CDM is within 1 day ( `time_to_tc` < 1) of the time to closest approach (TCA). This is because, in some cases, the latest available CDM is days away from the (known) time to closest approach. It would be wrong to assume that the computed risk 7 days before the actual time to closest approach can be a good approximation to the risk at TCA. Furthermore, predicting the risk many days prior the time to closest approach is not of great interest to us. On the other hand, the `training` set is unfiltered and you will find many cases where the latest available CDMs is days away from the TCA. We have chosen to keep these collision events in the training set because they may still be useful when it comes to predicting events from the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    " * There are no CDMs to learn from which are within 2 days of the TCA. In other words, the data available closest to the TCA will be at least 2 days away. This is because, as mentioned in the challenge section, a potential avoidance manoeuvre is planned at least 2 days prior to closest approach. Similarly to the above, the `training` set will contain all cases, including events where no data is available at least 2 days prior to closest approach (i.e. events with all their CDMs being within 2 days of TCA are still present in the dataset).\n",
    " \n",
    "### Columns Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is represented as a table, where each row correspond to a single CDM, and each CDM contains 103 recorded characteristics/features. There are thus 103 columns, which we describe below. The dataset is made of several unique collision/close approach events, which are identified in the `event_id` column. In turn, each collision event is made of several CDMs recorded over time. Therefore, a single collision event can be thought of as a times series of CDMs. From these CDMs, for every collision event, we are interested in predicting the final risk which is computed in the last CDM of the time series (i.e. the risk value in the last row of each collision event).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the column description, we first describe columns which have unique names and then the columns whose name difference only depends on whether they are referring to the target object (if the column name starts with a **t**) or the chaser object (if the column name starts with a **c**). Here, target refers to the ESA satellites while chaser refers to the space debris/object we want to avoid. describe the column names shared for both the chaser and the target, we replace **t** and **c** with the placeholder **x**. For instance, `c_sigma_r` and `t_sigma_r` both correspond to the description of `x_sigma_r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all the columns are numerical except for `c_object_type`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniquely Named Columns\n",
    "- `risk`:self-computed value at the epoch of each CDM [base 10 log]. **In the test set, this value is to be predicted, at the time of closest approach for each `event_id`.

    "\n",
    "This analysis includes the two different ways to estimate the probability density associated to a given data distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Parametric**: the statistical distribution of the real data is described by an analytical and well-known statistical probability distribution by estimating the parameters implicit in the function.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Non-parametric**: alternative method when the data distribution cannot be appropriately described analytically by a common probability distribution or cannot be easily made to fit the distribution (as it happens with multi-modal distributions). Among the multiple non-parametric methods available for Probability Density Estimation, the method used for estimating the probability density function of a continuous random variable in this analysis is the so-called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).\n",
    " \n",
    "The probability density function with wich all relevant continuous variables for which new data shall be generated, are fitted using both parametric and non-parametric methods and compared between each other to identify the one with the lowest Error Sum of Squares (SSE). For the parametric approach, a function is defined to find the statistical distribution that best fits the real data distribution of all existing continuous distributions available in [SciPy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html). In the non-parametric approach the `KernelDensity` estimator is used from [Scikit-learn.org](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/density.html) to fit a function to the continuous variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. - Parametric Probability Density estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The process to fit a parametric probability density estimation follows a series of steps for which it is convenient to develop segregated functions. For this purpose, the following functions are defined:\n",
    " - `fit_distribution`: Fits a statistical continuous distribution to the input data. It returns the distribution, its parameters adjusted, and the resulting SSE.\n",
    " - `make_pdf`: It creates an array to represent the probability density function using a given fitted distribution and its parameters.\n",
    " - `plot_dist`: Plots the probability density function and the data distribution histogram on a single chart for a visual interpretation of the probability density estimation. It supports the reader/data analyst to check appropriate fitting; some distributions may return low SSE but does not appropriately describe de distribution.\n"
