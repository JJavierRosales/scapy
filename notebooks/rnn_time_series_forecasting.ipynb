Care must be taken if you want to load this into another notebook to make sure all the target data is brought in properly.<br>\n","<tt><strong>Save:</strong>&nbsp;torch.save(model, PATH)<br><br>\n","<strong>Load:</strong>&nbsp;model = torch.load(PATH))<br>\n","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model.eval()</tt>\n","\n","In either method, you must call <tt>model.eval()</tt> to set dropout and batch normalization layers to evaluation mode before running inference. Failing to do this will yield inconsistent inference results.\n","\n","For more information visit https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.16"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
